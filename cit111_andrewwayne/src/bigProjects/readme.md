This project was to simulate a car race. There were a couple factors that were 
at play with regards to the car and the race. 
First was the tyre choice. The user can choose between three different options
of tyres, each offering different benefits, which brings me to my next two variables.
    Tyre wear: This is how quickly the tyre life degrades, thus making it more difficult to
get around the circuit at a quick pace.
    Lap Time: Is directly affected by what tyres you choose to run. This goes up
over the time that you are on the same tyre. 

The user also has to decide when to pit for new tyres, thus resetting tyre life 
and giving them better lap times. If the user doesn't pit at a good time, then 
not only does their lap time suffer, they run the risk of blowing up. If that were
to happen, they cannot complete the race. 
The goal is to get your car around the grand prix in the least amount of time possible.
